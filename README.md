# GifTastic

This is a simple GIF search program. 

Simply click on one of the instrument at the top of the page, and ten images related to the instrument will be displayed. Click on an image, and it will play a corresponding GIF.

To add a new instrument, type the instrument name into the input box on the right, and either click submit, or press enter.
